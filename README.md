# Capstone-Project-in-Cybersecurity
The Metasploitable virtual machine, a deliberately vulnerable target environment, was probed and analyzed from a Kali Linux attacker machine using a combination of Wireshark and Nmap network analysis tools. A thorough scan revealed a multitude of vulnerabilities categorized as critical, high, and medium severity based on their potential impact on the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Wireshark, a network protocol analyzer, captured and dissected network traffic in real-time, providing insights into the Metasploitable machine's communication patterns, open ports, and potential vulnerabilities exposed through unencrypted protocols. Nmap, a versatile network scanner, performed comprehensive port scans, service identification, and version detection, further illuminating the attack surface and potential entry points for exploitation.

The identified vulnerabilities ranged from outdated software versions with known exploits to weak passwords and misconfigurations. In particular, critical vulnerabilities were found in services like the Apache web server, allowing for remote code execution and unauthorized access. High-severity vulnerabilities included vulnerabilities in the operating system itself, enabling privilege escalation and potential takeover of the machine. Medium-severity issues, such as default credentials and unnecessary services, offered avenues for reconnaissance and potential lateral movement within a compromised network.

Following the discovery and analysis of these vulnerabilities, remediation steps were undertaken to secure the Metasploitable machine. This involved patching software, updating configurations, changing default credentials, disabling unnecessary services, and implementing stronger security measures like firewalls and intrusion detection systems. The process served as a valuable exercise in vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and defensive security practices in a controlled environment.
